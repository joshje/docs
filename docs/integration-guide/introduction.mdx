## Preface

Using software to monitor and control hardware in the real world is inherently a complex endeavor: there are many layers of applications that interact and can have bugs, networks can go down, and someone could unplug the device you care about at just about any time. Energy devices can be especially challenging, because of the high pace of innovation with new electric vehicles, networked solar inverters, and whole device categories coming online and becoming connected to the grid all the time.

Enode and our services exist to make this complexity as easy as possible for you to manage, so you can focus on engaging and helping consumers in transitioning to a more sustainable energy system.

This guide will tell you everything you need to know to get started integrating with Enode’s APIs and cover the basic concepts of what it will take to launch an initial version with real users. We recommend taking the time to read through the entirety of the guide to familiarize yourself with the Enode ecosystem and refer back to it when you have questions about product functionality once you’ve launched.

## Decisions to keep in mind

This guide is oriented around helping you bring an initial version to market with real users. As you read through, keep these recommendations and decisions in the back of your mind. Refer back to these as you develop and prepare to launch your integration.

### Recommendation 1: Start to prove your product’s value with a small cohort of users

- Who will your first users be and why?
- What are your goals for the product?
- What is the easiest way to begin to prove customer value with an initial version?

### Recommendation 2: Your initial version should only support a few brands until you’re ready to scale your product

- All devices have their own sets of real-world behavior and nuances. It can be overwhelming to learn all of them at once.
- What devices will work best for your use case and what devices do your first users care about the most?
- How will you prepare your support and operation teams for questions about real-world devices?
- If you choose to launch with devices with [limited capabilities](https://developers.enode.com/api/capabilities/vehicle) or less reliability, how will you set proper expectations with your initial users?

### Recommendation 3: First impressions are critical and properly set expectations in your UI

- How many devices do you expect a typical customer to link?
- What are the most important [sad paths](https://developers.enode.com/docs/integration-guide/sad-paths-and-errors) for my initial version to account for?

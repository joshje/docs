description: "Enode’s smart charging algorithm shifts electric vehicle charging to off-peak periods, reducing costs for end-users and helping balance the power grid load."

Based on two user inputs — a daily deadline and a charging location — smart charging is executed automatically. In day-to-day use, the end-user simply plugs in their vehicle, and the algorithm ensures charging occurs during the cheapest possible time window before the deadline.

To achieve this, our technology continuously calculates and analyzes a host of variables behind the scenes. We consider the deadline, live vehicle data, estimated charge time, and live electricity market data before passing it through a series of checks. This results in a charge plan that is executed automatically.

In this series of guides, we will detail the mechanisms and touch on aspects worth considering when designing and building smart charging functionality for your product.

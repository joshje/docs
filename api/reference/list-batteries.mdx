      Configuration settings for the battery
      
      <Accordion title="Child attributes">
        <ResponseField name="operationMode" type="string or null">
          The current operation mode of the battery.
          
          **Possible values:**
          
          - **SELF_RELIANCE**: Minimizes household reliance on the grid. Uses energy from solar or battery for household consumption before importing from the grid. Energy may be exported to the grid from solar, depending on excess solar and user settings in the OEM app.
          
          - **TIME_OF_USE**: Maximizes energy cost savings in accordance with a user-defined schedule matching a utility rate plan. Energy may be consumed from solar, battery, or grid sources, depending on current prices and user settings in the OEM app. Energy may be exported to the grid from solar or battery sources, depending on current prices and user settings in the OEM app.
          
          - **IMPORT_FOCUS**: Prioritizes charging the battery. Uses excess solar energy for charging and will charge from the grid if possible. Leveraged energy sources depend on the battery's configuration. Focus modes target a certain battery behavior but are ultimately internal to the battery; actual behavior might differ from the focus mode.
          
          - **EXPORT_FOCUS**: Prioritizes discharging energy stored in the battery back to the household and any excess to the grid. Grid exports often depend on local regulation and might require agreements with grid providers to be supported. Similar to `IMPORT_FOCUS`, focus modes target a certain battery behavior but are ultimately internal to the battery; actual behavior might differ from the focus mode.
          
          - **IDLE**: Prevents the battery from charging or discharging. The battery remains in a neutral state.
          
          - **UNKNOWN**: Indicates the battery mode is currently unknown. It might be possible to switch to a known mode, but actively returning to `UNKNOWN` is not possible.
        
            - Possible enum values:
	        `IMPORT_FOCUS`, `EXPORT_FOCUS`, `TIME_OF_USE`, `SELF_RELIANCE`, `IDLE`, `UNKNOWN`

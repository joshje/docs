### New battery operation mode: IDLE

- Maintain a specific state of charge over time with IDLE mode for batteries

	Setting a battery into IDLE mode enables battery optimization use cases such as:

	- **Prevent the battery from discharging** to cover household load - this is useful to shift discharging to a later point in time, for example when prices are high.
	- **Prevent the battery from charging** from solar - This is useful to ensure free battery capacity is available at a later point in time, for example when prices are low. Solar will continue to produce as normal, but the battery will not charge from it.

	IDLE mode is an important building block when optimizing batteries. Our initial release adds support for **SolarEdge** and **Solis** (hybrid) inverters connected to a battery. We are working towards supporting more vendors soon.

	To learn more, please visit our API documentation on [battery modes](https://developers.enode.com/api/capabilities/battery#operation-modes).

### Improved “Find by ID” usability and search hints

- Enhanced Find by ID with a clearer interface, helpful search hints, and support for VIN lookups to increase successful searches

	The Find by ID feature has been refined to increase successful searches and provide clearer guidance when no results are found. Enhancements include:

	- Built-in support for search by VIN
	- A revamped UI that makes the process clearer and more intuitive
	- Context-aware hints for cases such as attempting to search under an unintended client account, looking up users without associated assets, or entering familiar terms like vendor names instead of IDs

### EV Charger Dynamic Pairing - Seamless Vehicle and Charger Orchestration

Unified control and unlocked capabilities are now available to Early Adopters on an opt-in basis.

#### Unified Control

**Unified Control** allows you to manage EV charging using the [Vehicle APIAPI](https://developers.enode.com/api/reference#vehicles) and leverage any [supported charger](https://developers.enode.com/api/capabilities/charger) linked to the same Enode `userId`.

When a vehicle is plugged into a charger:

	- **Seamless orchestration:** Send commands to the Vehicle API as usual. Enode automatically coordinates with the charger for optimal control
	- **Fallback compatibility:** If the vehicle is unplugged or connected to a different charger, control remains unchanged via the vehicle only
	- **Smart Charging enhancement:** Vehicles with [Smart Charging](https://developers.enode.com/docs/smart-charging/introduction) enabled automatically leverage charger controls when executing their plan
	- **Scheduling enhancements:** Vehicles using [Schedules](https://developers.enode.com/docs/scheduling) automatically leverage charger controls when executing their schedule


	#### Unlocked Capabilities

	Linking a charger to the same user immediately unlocks previously unavailable vehicle capabilities:

	- **Charging control:** Vehicles gain `isCapable: true` for `startCharging` and `stopCharging` the moment a charger is linked
	- **Location detection:** Vehicles gain `isCapable: true` for `location` when it can be inferred from the charger
	- **Smart Charging eligibility:** Vehicles that previously lacked control capabilities are now eligible for Smart Charging

	By leveraging these unlocked capabilities, customers can expand the market reach of their managed EV charging programs.
